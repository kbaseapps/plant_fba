description : |

    <p>The PlantSEED pipeline was implemented within KBase to enable
    users to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks of plant
    primary metabolism. The documentation of the PlantSEED pipeline
    can be viewed <a
    href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/plant_fba/reconstruct_plant_metabolism">here</a></p>.

    <p>The resulting metabolic reconstruction contains a set of
    gene-reaction links that can be used to integrate several kinds of
    large datasets such as transcriptomes or metabolomes. This app was
    written to integrate the results generated by the KBase RNA-Seq
    pipeline, which results in a ExpressionMatrix, containing a set of
    gene abundances derived from different experimental
    conditions.</p>

    <p>The result of the integration is a Reaction Matrix, containing
    a set of computed reaction expression scores, for each of the same
    experimental conditions. The app generally applies the "best" gene
    abundance to a reaction, where there are multiple genes, and where
    there are genes encoding protein complexes. The underlying concept
    is that a reaction is only as "active" in its catalysis as allowed
    by the formation of the enzymes that catalyze the reaction. In
    turn, the results here can be used as a proxy for the activity of
    different primary metabolic pathways, and how they may respond to
    different experimental conditions.</p>
